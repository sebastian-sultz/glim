      <p> At the moment, our Future Messaging feature allows users to send an unlimited number of messages to their future selves. There are no restrictions on the number of messages a user can send, and each message can be scheduled for any future date.</p>

      <h2>Planned Enhancements</h2>
      <p>We plan to introduce a subscription model in the near future. Under this model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Free Access:</span>Each user will be allowed to send 2 free messages to their future self, with no need for a subscription.</li>
        <li><span>Premium Access:</span>Users who wish to send more than 2 messages will need to subscribe. The premium plan will allow users to schedule and manage up to 10 future messages. Additional functionality may be added in the future as part of the subscription model.</li>
      </ul>
